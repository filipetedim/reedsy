## Question 1
I've introduced myself a bit in the presentation letter and our emails, but I'll repeat some of it here anyway.
Personally, I'm quite a chilled out guy who likes to put out jokes and clear the mood around. I'm very curious and love being creative and learning new stuff. Not long ago I bought myself a RaspberryPi to make it into a gaming console, and stuck it inside an old PS1 case. Then I went and bought wood to make my own cat tree house, heh. I also have two cats. They're amaaazing. Best cats in the world, best cats. Huge cats. Huuuge. /referenceToEndOfWorld.

My hobbies nowadays consist of playing with my cats, watching series with my girlfriend, come up with crazy ideas to build/create stuff (like the PS1 RaspberryPi, etc), travelling around Belgium and nearby countries, and playing Resident Evil 7 with Playstation Virtual Reality goggles. I don't recommend it to the faint of heart, but it's one of the best VR experiences out there.

As for major achievements, I don't really know. For me a major achievement would be something really big, like sucessfully growing a child, or a potato crop. I've done some cool things I'm very proud of, like at 18 winning the national wide (Portugal) math contest, or in college being selected by others to represent the IT students in director/board/teacher meetings. I am also very proud of the LinkedIn PDF parser I've built for skeeled, but sadly I can't share it with you.
